# INF653 - Backend 1 Final Project

This project is to showcase what I have learned with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB by 
building a RESTful API around U.S. states data.

Get all US states data (from JSON file, merged with MongoDB fun facts)
Filter for contiguous or non-contiguous states
Get state details by abbreviation 
Get, add, update, and delete fun facts for states
Get state capital, nickname, population, and admission date
Friendly error messages and 404 handling
